## How use snippets?
When the extension is installed, open the source TypeScript file where you'll code your new TS decorator.

All snippets starts with the prefix "ts-dec", so, when you write this selector (and depending on how your editor is configured), a list of snippets will appear:

Then, select the snippet you want, and it will be appear ready to be filled:

The snippet is developed to facilitate your work as much as possible, so, once the snippet has been inserted in your code, the cursor will be placed in the name, to give you the possibility of naming it.
